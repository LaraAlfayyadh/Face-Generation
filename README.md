# Deep Learning Nanodegree - project4


## Project Overview
 In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. It is one of the projects from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible. The image below is a result of the training:
